Climate Disaster Project

This project entails gathering data from NOAA (weather) and EM-DAT (natural disasters), create and populate a remote database with that data, and perform analytics on it with a Jupyter Notebook. I am running a Postgresql database on Amazon Web Services and an EC2 remote server instance. This is automated with Airflow.
