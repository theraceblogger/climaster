Climate Disaster Project

The purpose of this project is to show if, and to what degree, there are correlations between climate change and natural disasters.

This entails gathering data from NOAA (weather) and EM-DAT (natural disasters), create and populate a remote database with that data, and perform analytics on it with a Jupyter Notebook. I am running a Postgresql database on Amazon Web Services and an EC2 remote server instance. This is automated with Airflow.
